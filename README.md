# Answer of the Universe  

> **"You are only one decision away from a completely different life."**

We make dozens of decisions every day — some small, others life-changing:  
- "Should I choose this university?"  
- "What if I pursue this major?"  
- "How would it feel to accept this offer?"  
- "Shall I go on a date with that person?"  

As a data enthusiast, I often draw insights from data and context to make logical choices. But there are times when decision fatigue sets in, and I just want to let intuition or the universe guide me.  

**Answer of the Universe** is my solution — a lightweight app designed to help you find clarity, humor, or solace whenever you need it.
